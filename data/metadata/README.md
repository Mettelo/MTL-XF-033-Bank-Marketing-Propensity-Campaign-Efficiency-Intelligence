**Grain:** One published campaign record, not an assured unique customer; source-row surrogate ID.

**Fields:** age, job, marital, education, default, balance, housing, loan, contact, day, month, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome, y.

**Evaluation:** Use first 60%, next 20%, last 20% in published record order, documenting that exact dates and repeated customers cannot be verified. Preserve order; train-only transforms; exclude duration and y. Treat contact/day/month/campaign as planned-context features only with explicit timing assumptions. Core pre-contact model also excludes contact, day, month and campaign unless separately evaluated as a labelled planned-contact scenario; this avoids treating the completed last contact as known before selection.

Use UTF-8 metadata, ISO dates and UTC retrieval times. Keep sensitive/raw contents and credentials out of logs; use IDs/hashes, and defanged security examples. Exact row accounting and seven-KPI lineage are mandatory. Team approval remains pending until executed; checked source references do not establish completed team analysis.
