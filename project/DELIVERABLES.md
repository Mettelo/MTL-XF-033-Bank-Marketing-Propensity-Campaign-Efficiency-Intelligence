# MTL-XF-033 — Deliverables and metric contracts

**Decision:** Compare capacity-limited contact lists and design a controlled term-deposit campaign pilot.

Required team outputs follow; this master does not claim they are complete. Each item needs a named author, distinct reviewer, version, evidence link and status.

## D1 — Discovery and requirements

**Due:** Week 2 · **Owner:** Business Analyst / Delivery Lead · **Team location:** docs/01-discovery/

Eight user requirements, prioritised by decision value, each with owner and measurable test; stakeholder map and as-is/to-be workflow for outbound campaign planning review.

**Pass evidence:** All eight link source support, D/AC/DT and Head of Retail Banking Marketing approval.

## D2 — Governed source and freeze

**Due:** Week 2 · **Owner:** Data Governance Analyst · **Team location:** docs/02-data-governance/

S1 provenance, rights, dictionary, storage/restore path and immutable byte manifest. Use bank-full.csv, all 45,211 records, from the nested bank.zip archive only. Do not stack bank.csv samples or bank-additional variants. Retain original order and categorical unknowns.

**Pass evidence:** Every required file/field is verified and approved; unsupported requirements explicitly block G1.

## D3 — Engineering pipeline and model

**Due:** Week 4 · **Owner:** Data Engineer · **Team location:** src/ and docs/03-data-model/

Versioned ingestion/transformation and curated model. Grain: One published campaign record, not an assured unique customer; source-row surrogate ID. Preserve file/sheet/row lineage and all exclusion reasons.

**Pass evidence:** Input=retained+excluded+quarantined exactly; no unexplained join multiplication; clean-run instructions exist.

## D4 — Quality and exceptions

**Due:** Week 4 · **Owner:** Data Engineer + independent reviewer · **Team location:** docs/04-data-quality/

Profile types, nulls, duplicates, sentinels, labels, units and source support. Address Using call duration or confusing propensity with causal uplift would create an invalid pre-call business case.

**Pass evidence:** Every treatment has affected count, reason, owner and reviewer; no silent row loss or coercion.

## D5 — KPI catalogue and lineage

**Due:** Week 4 · **Owner:** Campaign Strategy Analyst · **Team location:** docs/05-kpi-catalogue/

Implement K1–K7 below with actual source fields, code, valid population, denominator, units, grain, exclusions, owner and worked examples.

**Pass evidence:** All seven reviewed; K1–K5 reconcile independently and in BI on full cohort and one filtered slice.

## D6 — Analysis and evaluation

**Due:** Week 6 · **Owner:** Data Scientist / Decision Modelling Analyst · **Team location:** docs/06-analysis/

Use first 60%, next 20%, last 20% in published record order, documenting that exact dates and repeated customers cannot be verified. Preserve order; train-only transforms; exclude duration and y. Treat contact/day/month/campaign as planned-context features only with explicit timing assumptions. Core pre-contact model also excludes contact, day, month and campaign unless separately evaluated as a labelled planned-contact scenario; this avoids treating the completed last contact as known before selection.

**Pass evidence:** Baseline and alternative results, population/class counts, uncertainty, negative findings and feature/timing audit retained; no test-driven tuning.

## D7 — Decision policy and action register

**Due:** Week 6 · **Owner:** Campaign Strategy Analyst · **Team location:** docs/07-decision-framework/

Baseline selects a deterministic random 20% contact list (seed 33). Alternative selects top-scored 20% using a validation-selected model and locked tie rule. Evaluate subscriptions per 1,000 attempted contacts and assumed net value under £1/£3/£5 contact costs and £20/£50/£100 subscription value; all amounts are simulation assumptions.

**Pass evidence:** Both policies and sensitivity outputs supplied; every action has evidence, eligibility, owner, next review and uncertainty. Include a defer case.

## D8 — Dashboard / decision prototype

**Due:** Week 7 · **Owner:** BI / Decision Product Developer · **Team location:** dashboard/

Four linked views: K1–K7 executive overview, source-supported diagnostics, policy/action comparison and quality/limitations for Head of Retail Banking Marketing.

**Pass evidence:** Five metric/filter checks pass; frozen scope and limitations survive export; static copy/user guide require no paid access.

## D9 — Independent assurance and UAT

**Due:** Week 7 · **Owner:** Marketing Model Assurance Analyst · **Team location:** docs/08-assurance-uat/

Execute DT1–DT10 and three stakeholder tasks; record actual results and defects/retests.

**Pass evidence:** All ten tests and three tasks pass; zero unresolved critical/high defects.

## D10 — Technical/operational handover

**Due:** Week 8 · **Owner:** Engineer + Delivery Lead · **Team location:** docs/09-technical-handover/

One documented run entry point, dependency versions, manifest, output checksums/tolerances, refresh, rollback and operational owner.

**Pass evidence:** Second member reproduces all seven KPIs and policy queue from approved bytes; environment, elapsed time and discrepancies recorded.

## D11 — Executive recommendation

**Due:** Week 8 · **Owner:** Delivery Lead + domain specialist · **Team location:** deliverables/

8–12 slides and a 5–10-minute demo answering Compare capacity-limited contact lists and design a controlled term-deposit campaign pilot. Include five evidence-linked findings, three next actions, comparison and a defer case.

**Pass evidence:** Every numeric claim links tested evidence; costs/benefits and operational targets are labelled assumptions unless measured.

## D12 — Contribution and final submission

**Due:** Weekly; final week 8 · **Owner:** Delivery Lead · **Team location:** CONTRIBUTIONS.md and submission/FINAL_SUBMISSION.md

Named D owners/reviewers, authored work, issues/PRs/commits, substantive reviews and demo/handover contribution for each member.

**Pass evidence:** All D/AC/DT evidence links resolve at final commit/tag; individual contribution is demonstrated beyond bulk upload or commit count.

## K1–K7 — Authoritative contracts

| ID | Metric | Definition and population | Grain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K1 | Subscription rate | count(y=yes)/valid y records; retain unknown inputs as categories. | campaign record cohort |
| K2 | Contact burden | mean and median campaign contacts; report extreme values separately. | subscription group |
| K3 | Prior-contact coverage | count(pdays≠−1)/valid pdays records; −1 means no previous contact. | cohort |
| K4 | Precision at capacity | subscribers in selected top 20% / selected records. | test |
| K5 | Recall at capacity | subscribers in selected list / all test subscribers. | test |
| K6 | Lift at capacity | selected-list subscription rate / overall test subscription rate. | test |
| K7 | Assumed campaign net value | selected count × (observed selected subscription fraction × assumed subscription value − assumed contact cost); no causal or realised-profit claim. | nine cost/value scenarios |

Extend each contract with actual S1 raw fields and curated columns, code lineage, population/exclusions, numerator/denominator, units/grain, aggregation, missing/zero/undefined policy, owner/reviewer, freeze ID and tests. Campaign Strategy Analyst owns interpretation; Engineer implements; Marketing Model Assurance Analyst reviews.

Zero denominators produce unavailable values with reasons. Do not average subgroup rates when compatible summed numerators/denominators are required. Show class/segment counts beside rates and uncertainty. Counts reconcile exactly; arithmetic reconciles unrounded or to a documented tolerance no wider than 0.01 displayed unit. No source field can silently be replaced by an assumption.

## Evaluation and decision policy

Use first 60%, next 20%, last 20% in published record order, documenting that exact dates and repeated customers cannot be verified. Preserve order; train-only transforms; exclude duration and y. Treat contact/day/month/campaign as planned-context features only with explicit timing assumptions. Core pre-contact model also excludes contact, day, month and campaign unless separately evaluated as a labelled planned-contact scenario; this avoids treating the completed last contact as known before selection.

Baseline selects a deterministic random 20% contact list (seed 33). Alternative selects top-scored 20% using a validation-selected model and locked tie rule. Evaluate subscriptions per 1,000 attempted contacts and assumed net value under £1/£3/£5 contact costs and £20/£50/£100 subscription value; all amounts are simulation assumptions.

**Interpretation boundary:** No stable customer ID is available. duration leaks completed-call information and must be excluded from pre-call prioritisation. Historical subscription probability is not incremental campaign uplift; consent, customer vulnerability and actual account profitability are absent.
