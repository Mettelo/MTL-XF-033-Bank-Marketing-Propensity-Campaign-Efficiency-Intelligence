# MTL-XF-033 — Bank Marketing Propensity Campaign Efficiency Intelligence

**Track:** Cross-Functional · **Use case:** Commercial / private sector · **Team:** 6–8 · **Duration:** 8 weeks

This is a simulated confidential-client engagement using public/open data. Stakeholders and commercial/security scenarios are fictional. Do not claim real-client employment, endorsement, operational deployment or realised benefits. This master pack specifies work to be completed; it does not claim the team has executed it.

## Business commission

**Client:** Confidential Retail Bank. **Decision owner:** Head of Retail Banking Marketing. **Cadence:** outbound campaign planning review.

A bank's outbound team has a fixed contact capacity but relies on broad lists. Historical subscription patterns may improve prioritisation, yet call duration is only known after a call and historical targeting does not establish the effect of contacting a customer.

**Decision:** Compare capacity-limited contact lists and design a controlled term-deposit campaign pilot.

## End-to-end delivery

Deliver business requirements, governed source acquisition, engineering and data quality, seven defined metrics, baseline/alternative policy comparison, decision dashboard, assurance/UAT, executive recommendation and operational handover. A model alone is insufficient.

Baseline selects a deterministic random 20% contact list (seed 33). Alternative selects top-scored 20% using a validation-selected model and locked tie rule. Evaluate subscriptions per 1,000 attempted contacts and assumed net value under £1/£3/£5 contact costs and £20/£50/£100 subscription value; all amounts are simulation assumptions.

## Core dataset and frozen cohort

**S1:** [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222). **Input:** bank.zip → bank-full.csv and bank-names.txt. **Source population:** 45,211 records in bank-full.csv.

Use bank-full.csv, all 45,211 records, from the nested bank.zip archive only. Do not stack bank.csv samples or bank-additional variants. Retain original order and categorical unknowns.

No stable customer ID is available. duration leaks completed-call information and must be excluded from pre-call prioritisation. Historical subscription probability is not incremental campaign uplift; consent, customer vulnerability and actual account profitability are absent.

No raw data are uploaded by this update. Teams preserve original bytes outside Git in an approved durable snapshot, with checksums, source metadata and reviewer access. The source register records verification evidence and acquisition rules.

## Evaluation and policy boundary

Use first 60%, next 20%, last 20% in published record order, documenting that exact dates and repeated customers cannot be verified. Preserve order; train-only transforms; exclude duration and y. Treat contact/day/month/campaign as planned-context features only with explicit timing assumptions. Core pre-contact model also excludes contact, day, month and campaign unless separately evaluated as a labelled planned-contact scenario; this avoids treating the completed last contact as known before selection.

**Primary risk:** Using call duration or confusing propensity with causal uplift would create an invalid pre-call business case.

At G1 (week 2), approve requirements, source rights, actual schema and frozen bytes. At G2 (week 4), approve row accounting, all seven metrics and evaluation design. At G3 (week 6), review baseline/alternative and uncertainty. At G4 (week 8), require all twelve deliverables, ten executed domain tests, three UAT tasks, five reconciliations and a distinct-member clean rerun.

Assign named authors and review partners. Unsupported mandatory outputs remain blocked until an approved source/scope change resolves them. Record actual results in a separate Mettelo team repository; this master defines the work.
